Tablemaster is quick and dirty php web app where to manage a database table.  Simply provide the table name and the databae credentials in the config file and that is it. It does a simple add, modify, and delete on the table. It uses the MySQL PDO. 

Just keep all the class files with the index.php and all will be good.
